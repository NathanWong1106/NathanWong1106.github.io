            By capturing and training on landmark data from my hand, I was able to make a ML model that could predict a hand gesture captured
            on a webcam. The model can also be extended to recognize custom hand gestures.
            Curently there are no further projects planned to incorporate this, but it certainly could be implemented somewhere in the future.
            More details on the specific implementation and training can be found in the Github link above.

            Relatively simple program made as the summative project for Gr.12 Computer Science. As input it takes a regular photo/image then 
            attempts to convert it into pixel art through an algorithmic pipeline. The user also gets to choose between 3 processing algorithms
            and pixel dimensions. While the end result is not necessarily complicated, the program successfully implements some key concepts such
            as OOP, threading, data structures (maps, arrays, lists, etc), and custom algorithms.

            The codebase for this project makes me want to go blind as it was one of the first "large (perhaps largest?)" personal projects I ever got into.
            Suboptimal design decisions, lack of overall structure, misunderstanding async calls, and repetitive code are some of the major problems that could be fixed.
            Despite that, I learned so much while making the bot that it has to be in this list. This is a Discord bot with a plethora of features including:
                <ol className="my-4 list-disc list-inside ml-4"> 
                    <li>Currency system</li>
                    <li>Custom playlists</li>
                    <li>Persistent MongoDB database</li>
                    <li>Playing music</li>
                    <li>YouTube, Reddit, and more APIs</li>
                </ol>
            It's been quite a long time since I last worked on this project but perhaps I'll continue to remake the bot in the future.

            A work in progress (one that will probably never be finished). This is a static website hosted using Github Pages and built with Gatsby.
            The pre-compiled code is written in React and styled using TailwindCSS and some custom CSS (I plan to learn Sass soon). No idea how many
            sacred UI/UX conventions I've broken here :)
