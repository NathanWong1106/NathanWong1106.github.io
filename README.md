# Static Website for Github Pages

## So basically:
* Don't want the pain of pure html, js, css... time for React
* Github pages only supports static pages... Gatsby generates static pages from React
* Bad at design... TailwindCSS can help with that

# About this Repo:
The master branch is filled with the compiled contents of the website (by what I assume is Gatsby/Webpack magic) that Github Pages deploys.
The src branch is the ~~terrible~~ code written by me.
